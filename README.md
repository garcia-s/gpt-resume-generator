#This is an resume generator that uses chat gpt to generate a customized resume based on your experience and soft skills

As many companies decided to automate the process of selection using ATS software, effectively using software against us techies.
I decided to create a tool that is capable of surpassing the requirements of ATS software to re-enable users to talk to a real human being again.

Resumes are discarded about 75% of the time, so it makes sense to automate the process of generating resumes.

You can obfuscate the usage of this tool with other language models or edit the templates or styles of your resume, this is up to you.

Remember, skills cannot be faked, experience cannot be emulated. We are trying to bypass unnecesary and inflexible software based restrictions. Even though this tool might help you landing interviews, it is not a replacement for your knowledge.

Do not lie about your experience, if you do not know python, do not put 10 years of experience in python, I promise is not going to go well in you technical interview.
